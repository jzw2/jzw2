Good job finding my github profile.

If you are reading this, I assume you are either a potential employer or otherwise stalking me for fun.

# Languages

I've learned (and partially forgotten) a lot of languages.
The mainstream ones that I used in university were
- Python
- Java
- C++
- C

But I quite enjoy some not as well known languages like
- Rust
- Haskell
- Prolog

And some languages that I've used before but I've forgotten a decent amount
- Ruby
- Lua
- Lisp
- OCaml

In particular, I've written rust code on github as a compromise of my interests and practicality

# Technologies
- React
    Back in 2020, I had an internship that had me learn React along with web technologies such as Typescript and CSS.
- Docker
    I have some basic experience with Docker and creating/using images.
- Git
    I have been using Git for almost 15 years. My Github account was made in 2017.
- Linux
    I use Nixos. 

# Interests
I was perviously more interested in academia as opposed to industry. Due to having more of a math background, I liked

- Functional Programming
- Haskell
- Prolog
- Formal Methods


# About me / Mental Health struggles
I graduated from Urbana Champaign in 2021 with two degrees: BS in computer science and a BA in linguistics. I also got a minor in math.

I moved to Germany in 2022 to pursue a degree in computational linguistics. 
During this time, I had a lot of trouble making friends and was dissatisfied with the degree.
I became quite depressed and lonely. I attempted to join a club (Fachschaft in German) in an attempt to make friends. 
Although I made some acquaintences, I also met one individual whose behavior was inappropriate and disrespectful. 
After talking with some people who had quit the Fachschaft because of her behavior, I decided to call her out on her behavior.
Her behavior only became worse to me after I did that, frequently making sarcastic remarks and personal insults. Eventually, it became so bad that I couldn't take it anymore, and I too quit. Because of this incident, I think I subconsciously thought I just wasn't a likeable person, even though it was just one person. As a result, I've spent the years after that quite isolated. During that time, I think I only saw about one or two people regularly.

This worsened the depression a lot. Although I began seeing a therapist, it was not very helpful. The antidepressants were helpful in the beginning, but then I began falling back into depression after a while. It was also during this time that I was writing my master's thesis. I picked a supervisor that had high standards and little time. Depression had impacted my ability to work effectively and semester after semester, I failed to submit the thesis. This dragged on for two years, until I finally submitted at the end of 2025. 

As a result, a lot of what I have to show on my Github is kind of old, as I have not been a very good mental state to write quality code.
So if you are potential employer, I hope you understand my situation and still consider me for whatever position I applied for.
