Good job finding my github profile.

If you are reading this, I assume you are either a potential employer or otherwise stalking me for fun.

# About me
I graduated from Urbana Champaign in 2021 with two degrees: BS in computer science and a BA in linguistics. I also got a minor in math.

I moved to Germany in 2022 to pursue a degree in computational linguistics. 
During this time, I had a lot of trouble making friends and was dissatisfied with the degree.
I became quite depressed and lonely. I attempted to join a club (Fachschaft in German) in an attempt to make friends. 
Although I made some acquaintences, I also met one individual whose behavior was inappropriate and disrespectful. 
After talking with some people who had quit the Fachschaft because of her behavior, I decided to call her out on her behavior.
Her behavior only became worse to me after I did that, frequently making sarcastic remarks and personal insults. Eventually, it became so bad that I couldn't take it anymore, and I too quit. As a result, I've spent the years after that quite isolated. 

This worsened the depression a lot. Although I began seeing a therapist, it was not very helpful. The antidepressants were helpful in the beginning, but then I began falling back into depression after a while. It was also during this time that I was writing my master's thesis. I picked a supervisor that had high standards and little time. Depression had impacted my ability to work effectively and semester after semester, I failed to submit the thesis. This dragged on for two years, until I finally submitted at the end of 2025. 

As a result, a lot of what I have to show on my Github is kind of old, as I have not been a very good mental state to write quality code.
So if you are potential employer, I hope you understand my situation and still consider me for whatever position I applied for.
